    "instructions": "Bring a saucepan of salted water it a boil, reduce the heat, and maintain a simmer. In a bowl, stir all the ingredients together (eggs, flour, milk, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg). Place a colander over the pan, pour about1/4 of the batter into the colander, and press through the holes with a plastic spatula into the hot water. When the spatzle starts to float to the surface, cover the pan and keep covered until the spatzle appears to swell and is fluffy. Remove the dumplings and repeat the procedure with the remaining batter.\r\n\r\nIn a medium saute pan, add butter, and melt over medium heat until butter turns a light brown. Add garlic and cook until it becomes lightly colored. Add spaetzle to the pan to heat through. Add parsley, cheese, salt and pepper, to taste.",
